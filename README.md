## Features

- **Chatbot Integration**: A conversational chatbot interface powered by Ollama's Llama 3.2 model.
- **Multi-Modal Capabilities**: Supports both text and image-based interactions, enabling richer user experiences.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with TailwindCSS for seamless responsiveness.
- **Reusable Components**: Includes pre-built components like a carousel.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Fully supports light and dark themes.

## Multi-Modal Capabilities

The GenAI Toolkit now supports multi-modal interactions, allowing users to:

1. **Text-Based Chat**: Communicate with the chatbot using natural language.
2. **Image-Based Queries**: Upload images to receive context-aware responses or recommendations.

### How It Works

- **Text Input**: The chatbot processes user queries using the Llama 3.2 model.
- **Image Input**: Images are analyzed using integrated AI tools, and results are combined with text-based responses for a seamless experience.

To enable image-based interactions, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Refer to the `utils/` folder for helper functions related to image processing.
